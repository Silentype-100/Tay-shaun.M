    <p>Hello, to everyone who views my page! My name is Tay'Shaun Martin, and
     I'm 20 years old.
     My favorite color blue,and my birthday is October 17th.
     In my family, I'm considered tall at 5'9".
      I love playing video games, though I dont have a single favorite; each game excels
       in different areas that others may not.
       Each games excels at something that another game does'nt.
        Additionally, I'm a big fan of anime, with several favoites.
        One of my top picks is "Fairytail",
         which follows a unique guild of wizards as they fight against evil.

       <br><br>I also enjoy exercising, and my favorite gym equipment is the bench press.
          Currently, my personal best for the bench pressed is 155 pounds without a
          spotter and my goal is to reach 225 pounds. </p>
